# CapSoul

CapSoul is an innovative online platform designed to revolutionize the way we connect with our memories and future selves. It offers a unique time-travel experience, allowing users to navigate through their history by preserving memories and sending letters to their future selves. 

## Inspiration

The idea for CapSoul was born out of our own experiences as college students dealing with homesickness, especially for those of us who are international students. The desire to preserve the precious moments spent both at home and during our college journey motivated us to create a digital time capsule, enabling us to keep these memories alive and revisit them in the future.

## What it does

CapSoul allows users to store their memories and send letters to their future selves. Users can select dates when they wish to receive these letters and photos, creating a personalized memory space filled with unforgettable moments. This platform makes it possible to immortalize thoughts and sentiments through personal letters and photos, bridging the gap between past and future selves.

## How we built it

Our project leverages **Next.js** for the frontend and **ASP.NET** for the backend REST API. We styled our application using the **TailwindCSS** component library, with additional UI enhancements provided by **DaisyUI**. The platform enables users to upload content such as text, images, and MP3 files, which are then "sent to space" and retrieved at a later date.

## Challenges we ran into

Throughout the development process, we faced several challenges, including difficulties with GitHub management, merge conflicts, and data loss. Integrating the backend with the frontend also presented challenges, particularly with CORS issues and ensuring that form data matched the API schema.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite the challenges, we are proud of our ability to collaborate effectively and complete a significant portion of the project. This experience has enhanced our problem-solving skills and pushed us out of our comfort zones, fostering quick thinking and efficient decision-making.

## What we learned

Participating in this hackathon has improved our problem-solving abilities and coding skills, especially in advanced usage of Next.js. We've gained valuable experience in teamwork and project management under tight deadlines.

## What's next for CapSoul

We plan to continue developing CapSoul, expanding our services as we gather more customer data. Our future goals include utilizing generative AI to predict and create future letters, enhancing the time-travel experience for our users by allowing them to navigate between the past and future more seamlessly.

- TypeScript

## Github

- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/your-github-repo-link)

## Try it out

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
